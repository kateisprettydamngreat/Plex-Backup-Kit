Just a quick Windows backup tool for plex. Be sure to modify the destination, as it almost certainly is going to differ for you. If you installed plex default settings, source can be left untouched. Cheers.
Made this because I do it somewhat frequently, figured someone might use it.

Don't forget to reopen the port, if you reinstall windows. New device id.
